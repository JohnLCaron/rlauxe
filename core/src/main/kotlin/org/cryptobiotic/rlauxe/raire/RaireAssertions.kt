Not Eliminated Next (NEN) Assertions. "IRV Elimination"
NEN assertions compare the tallies of two candidates under the assumption that a specific set of
candidates have been eliminated. An instance of this kind of assertion could look like this:
  NEN: Alice > Bob if only {Alice, Bob, Diego} remain.

Not Eliminated Before (NEB) Assertions. "Winner Only"
Alice NEB Bob is an assertion saying that Alice cannot be eliminated before Bob, irrespective of which
other candidates are continuing.
