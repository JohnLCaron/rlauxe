"The assumption has been made in the ""Estimated # of CVRs to audit"" value that all ballot cards were returned for each ballot. Therefore, the number of CVRs is the ballots cast total multiplied by the number of cards. As the average number of cards per ballot decreases the number of ballots to audit will also decrease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
