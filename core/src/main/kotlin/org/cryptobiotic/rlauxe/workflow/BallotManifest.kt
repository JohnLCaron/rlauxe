// The id must uniquely identify the paper ballot. Here it may be some simple thing (seq number) that points to
// the paper ballot location. Its necessary that the system publically commit to that mapping before the Audit,
// as well as to sampleNum.
// TODO conform better to this spec:
// B7. Proper bookkeeping of voter participation records and voter registration, and proper ballot
//      accounting. This gives a trustworthy upper bound on the number of cards validly cast in each
//      contest under audit. This upper bound must come from some procedure distict/decoupled from the voting system/equipment
// B8. The ballots are stored securely, creating a trustworthy but possibly incomplete paper trail (some ballots might be missing).
//      A ballot manifest is created (untrusted, possibly by card style), giving a list of where the ballots are.
//      It may also be a style manifest which tells you which contests are on which ballots. This does not need to be trusted, but the upper bounds on
//      the number of cards for each contest do.
// B9. Untrusted imprinter claims to assign a unique identifier to every card in the manifest. Imprinter
//      commits to the identifiers it claims to have used. Identifiers, once applied, cannot be altered.
//      Once audit starts, identifiers cannot be added.
// B10. Voting system commits to reported winners and possibly other information such as totals, batch
//      subtotals, or CVRs. Public commitment to CVRs can shroud votes, eg using SOBA or VAULT.
//      For card-level comparison audits, each CVR is labeled with a unique identifier from the set of
//      identifiers previously reported (checked later). Identifier is in plaintext even if votes are shrouded.

// C16. Commit to and disclose mapping from PRNG output to identifiers.

// The term ballot style generally refers to the set of contests on a given voterâ€™s ballot. (Ballot

// be of two different styles.) Here, we use card style to refer to the set of contests on a given
// ballot card, and CSD to refer to card-style data for an election. (MoreStyle p.2)
