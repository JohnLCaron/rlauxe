RLA alliance

Mission is to produce open-source, free as in beer, production quality software libraries for use in public elections to conduct public RLAs.
The libraries are used by the vendors that sell voting systems to integrate RLA capabilities.

Incorporate the latest academic research and best practices of RLA into production software.
Inform and educate public election officials.
Publish working example software that captures common configurations and needs.

produce and maintain the libraries, conformance suites, interoperability specifications.

Attract software developers to contribute. 
Attract researchers and academics to contribute.
Attract RLA experts to contribute.

Non goals: create full voting systems. Our libraries are used by the vendors that sell voting systems.

interoperable/conformance
standardized error reporting / logging.

3 languages: python (maybe), rust, kotlin/java.

Arlo
Shangrla
colorado-rla
california?

what are the features we need to provide? minimal viable product? colorado-rla?

algorithm-only library, make the math independent of the integration in order to provide uniform capabilities.

API 

integrators - interface with jurisdictions, provide support, customization, and value added. 
Eventually these are the people we are "selling" to.

Use web server to communicate.
Pull the database and web framework out, "algorithm-only library".

Prototype: is this feasible?

abstract the RLA part out of colorado-rla.
Talk to raire.
create a conformance test
rust and kotlin?

focus on api
